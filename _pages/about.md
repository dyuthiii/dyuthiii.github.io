I'm Dyuthi Dinesh, a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a Master's in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences. 
My academic journey began at the University of British Columbia, where I earned a B.Sc. in Psychology with honors. My professional experience includes working as a Clinical Researcher at Wysa, an AI conversational agent for mental health support. 

I am interested in research for social impact. Topics that I would love to work on include mental health, (digital) healthcare, gaming, social media misinformation mitigation, political polarization, data bias research, and other social issues that can benefit from data science and analysis.
Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm passionate about using data and AI for good. I'm always eager to learn and apply my skills to new challenges in the field of psychology and quantitative research, and to help address political, psychological and social issues through research and data.

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy gaming, crocheting, and reading. Another significant part of my life is my love for animals. 
I've looked after and rescued a bunch of animals, from guinea pigs to kittens! In my free time, I volunteer for animal rescue and rehabilitation and have been independently rescuing stray animals around Bangalore, India.
