I'm Dyuthi Dinesh, a recently graduated Master's student from Columbia University who focused on Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences. 
I have a passion for AI Safety & Ethics, and my research interests encompass Quantitative Methods, Supervised/Unsupervised Model Training & Evaluation. My work has involved 2.5 years of research, development & safety evaluation of LLM frameworks in mental health. I also have experience in large-scale data
analysis.
I am interested in research for social impact. Topics that I would love to work on include mental health, (digital) healthcare, gaming, social media misinformation mitigation, political polarization, data bias research, and other social issues that can benefit from data science and analysis.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm passionate about using data and AI for good. I'm always eager to learn and apply my skills to new challenges in the field of psychology and quantitative research, and to help address political, psychological and social issues through research and data.
When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy gaming, crocheting, and reading. Another significant part of my life is my love for animals. 
I've looked after and rescued a bunch of animals, from guinea pigs and kittens, to my best boy- a pug named Milo!
