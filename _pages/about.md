I'm Dyuthi Dinesh, a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a Master's in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences. 
My academic journey began at the University of British Columbia, where I earned a B.Sc. in Psychology with honors. 
Throughout my studies, I've developed a strong foundation in research methodologies, data analysis, and statistical techniques, which I've applied to various projects in social psychology, neuroscience, and mental health.
My professional experience includes working as a Clinical Researcher at Wysa, an AI conversational agent for mental health support. 
In this role, I conducted mixed-method research, including Randomized Controlled Trials, to test the efficacy of digital mental health interventions. 
I've also contributed to several research projects at UBC, exploring topics such as COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, climate change beliefs, and deception detection in real-life conversations. 
I am interested in research that studies, and helps mitigate misinformation, particularly on social media.
Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm passionate about using data and AI for good. 
I love exploring new avenues where data can be used to address pitfalls in society, and I hope to utilize my skills to make the STEM field more equitable and inclusive. 
I'm always eager to learn and apply my skills to new challenges in the field of psychology and quantitative research, and to help address political, psychological and social issues through research and data. 
Many topics that I am open to working on include social media misinformation, political polarization, the climate crisis, gender-gap in research, data bias in research, mental health, and other social issues that can benefit from data science and analysis.
I am also interested in fields of digital health and gaming. 

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy gaming, crocheting, and reading. Another significant part of my life is my love for animals. 
Growing up, I had the pleasure of caring for four guinea pigs, and currently, I am lucky to have the most amazing boy named Milo. 
In my free time, I volunteer for animal rescue and rehabilitation and have been independently rescuing stray animals around Bangalore, India. 

Feel free to explore my website further to learn more about my work and interests.
