### Ethics & Usage lead at GradeMate, Columbia University
*Project*: GradeMate is an AI-integrated approach to support instructors in evaluating student assignments. The app leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to read through assignments and provide feedback to students.
*Role*: As GradeMate is currently in its infancy, my role in the organization has been studying ethical considerations, and developing guardrails for our model. My role has involved literature review, LLM performance analysis, 
statistical analysis, conducting a systematic internal study to evaluate bias (utilizing API to study bias in grading based on races, ethnicities, gender, and nationalities). I am also in the process of outlining a UX Research study for when the app is safe and ready for testing.
*Learning Outcomes*: Statistical Analysis of LLM Performace, AI-Ethics Research, Research Design, UX Research.
